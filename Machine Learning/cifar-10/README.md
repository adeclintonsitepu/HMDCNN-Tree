# Modular Neural Network with Hierarchical Organization

This repository contains the code for "Optimized Visual Recognition Based on The Modular Neural Network with Hierarchical Organization" paper by Ade Clinton Sitepu and Chuan-Ming Liu.

## Description
This repository is the code for Machine Learning [1] Techniques for image classification tasks on CIFAR-10 Dataset. The reference article: [CIFAR-10: KNN-based Ensemble of Classifiers](https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.04905)

[1] [CIFAR-10 Classification Project, The American University in Cairo, By Yehya Abouelnaga, Hager Rady, and Ola Salem](https://github.com/devyhia/cifar-10)

The original Machine Learning techniques code By Yehya Abouelnaga, Hager Rady, and Ola Salem.

In this code, they try to optimize the performance of CIFAR-10 Image classification.

This repository contains the code for "Optimized Visual Recognition through a Deep Convolutional Neural Network with Hierarchical Modular Organization" paper by Ade Clinton Sitepu and Chuan-Ming Liu.

## Description
This repository is the code for Machine Learning [1] Techniques for image classification tasks on CIFAR-10 Dataset. The reference article: [CIFAR-10: KNN-based Ensemble of Classifiers](https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.04905)

[1] [CIFAR-10 Classification Project, The American University in Cairo, By Yehya Abouelnaga, Hager Rady, and Ola Salem](https://github.com/devyhia/cifar-10)

The original Machine Learning techniques code By Yehya Abouelnaga, Hager Rady, and Ola Salem.

In this code, they try to optimize the performance of CIFAR-10 Image classification.
